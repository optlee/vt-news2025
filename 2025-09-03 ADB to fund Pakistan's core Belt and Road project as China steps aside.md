ISLAMABAD -- Pakistan has decided to proceed with its largest project of the Belt and Road Initiative with a loan from the Asian Development Bank now that Beijing has retreated due to mounting concerns over unpaid power sector dues and security challenges.

A government official who is privy to the development and requested anonymity told Nikkei Asia that the ADB is set to provide a $2 billion loan for upgrading the 480-kilometer Karachi-Rohri section of the Main Line-1 (ML-1) railway.

The ML-1 is the largest piece of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a $50 billion Pakistani portion of the [Belt and Road](https://asia.nikkei.com/spotlight/belt-and-road). With a total cost of $6.7 billion, the project entails upgrading the 1,726-kilometer railway that connects Karachi, on the Arabian Sea coast, and Peshawar, in northwestern Pakistan.

In July, a group of technical officials from the ADB inspected the section before agreeing to provide the loan. If the ADB actually extends a loan to this project, it would be the first instance of a core Belt and Road project in Pakistan to be financed by the ADB, excluding ancillary infrastructure.

The government source added that the rate will fluctuate based on market conditions and, as such, will be less favorable than the kind of concessional loans that such projects are often granted.

A spokesperson for Pakistan Railways, the ADB and the Chinese Embassy in Islamabad did not respond to Nikkei's requests for comments.

The interest rate would have been much lower if the loan had come from China under the CPEC, in which case the interest and Sinosure rates -- fees to China Export & Credit Insurance -- would have been subsidized, two officials told Nikkei.

But Beijing has backed out. During his visit to Islamabad on Aug. 21, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi welcomed third-party participation, according to a press handout. This was a stark departure from China's previous position that it would be the ML-1's sole funder.

In 2017, Ahsan Iqbal, then-planning minister, told the media that Pakistan had declined an ADB offer to fund the ML-1 as China wanted to singlehandedly finance the railway upgrade.

Experts pointed out multiple factors preventing Beijing from funding the ML-1.

"When China reviewed the \[ML-1\] financials, expected returns and Pakistan's problems with \[power\] payments, it decided against funding the project," Haroon Sharif, chairman of the Pakistan Regional Economic Forum, told Nikkei.

Pakistan owes $1.5 billion to Chinese power producers.

"After the killing of 21 Chinese nationals \[since 2021\], Beijing has grown cautious in expanding its footprint in Pakistan," he added.

Muhammad Tayyab Safdar, an assistant professor at the University of Virginia, said the Chinese reluctance to fund the ML-1 stems from Pakistan's repeated back-and-forth on project design. "Chinese institutions submitted \[ML-1\] feasibility reports several times, but the planning ministry \[of Pakistan\] kept sending them back to the Ministry of Railways to recalibrate costs."

ML-1 project costs were initially agreed upon at $6.8 billion, revised to $9.85 billion in 2022 and cut to $6.7 billion in 2023 at Pakistan's request. This final number remains the current estimate.

"After CPEC, Pakistan failed to take off economically and put its house in order," Muhammad Shoaib, a postdoctoral fellow at George Mason University in the U.S., told Nikkei. "Instead of interfering and influencing domestic policy choices, China preferred Pakistan to go to global and regional lenders \[to step in\]. That saves China from risks."

Experts explained that with a multilateral lender like the ADB in the mix, the ML-1 project now stands out from other CPEC projects.

"When China funded a project under CPEC, it usually involved shortlisting five companies and letting Pakistan pick one," Safdar from the University of Virginia told Nikkei. "ADB's procurement and structuring are far more detailed and time-consuming."

Sharif, who once served as the chairman of Pakistan's Board of Investment, said that with the ADB's arrival, competitive bidding will be used in granting contracts. "It will not be a \[government-to-government\] contract, where Beijing can bring their own contractors, which had been the case of other CPEC projects," Sharif added.

Some experts view China's withdrawal from ML-1 as a fundamental shift in bilateral economic relations.

Safdar said China's withdrawal signals a retrenchment or at least a rethinking of its role in Pakistan. "There seems to be a realization in Beijing that infrastructure projects in Pakistan may need to include other partners, rather than being solely China-funded," he said.

Shoaib, from George Mason University, disagrees. "Pakistan has gone to the IMF at least three times after the first phase of CPEC," he said. "It's unlikely that a project like ML-1 can impact China-Pakistan economic relations, which, in any case, are transforming in nature."
