WASHINGTON/BRUSSELS (Financial Times) -- Donald Trump has asked the EU to impose tariffs of up to 100% on India and China as part of a joint effort to increase pressure on Russia to end its war in Ukraine, according to three officials familiar with the matter.  
华盛顿/布鲁塞尔（金融时报）——据三位知情官员透露，唐纳德·特朗普已要求欧盟对印度和中国征收高达 100% 的关税，作为联合向俄罗斯施压以结束其在乌克兰战争的努力的一部分。

The president made the extraordinary demand after dialing into a meeting on Tuesday between senior U.S. and EU officials gathered in Washington to discuss ways to heighten the economic cost of the war for Moscow.  
周二，美国和欧盟高级官员在华盛顿举行会议，讨论如何增加莫斯科因战争而付出的经济代价，奥巴马在会上提出了这一非同寻常的要求。

"We're ready to go, ready to go right now, but we're only going to do this if our European partners step up with us," one U.S. official said.  
一位美国官员表示：“我们已经做好准备，现在就准备出发，但只有我们的欧洲伙伴与我们并肩作战，我们才会这样做。”

A second U.S. official said Washington was prepared to "mirror" any tariffs on China and India imposed by the EU, potentially leading to a further increase in U.S. levies on imports from both countries.  
第二位美国官员表示，华盛顿准备“效仿”欧盟对中国和印度征收的任何关税，这可能导致美国进一步提高对这两个国家进口产品的关税。

Trump's proposal comes amid frustration within the White House at the difficulty of brokering a peace deal and Russia's increasingly aggressive aerial attacks on Ukraine.  
特朗普提出这一提议的背景是，白宫内部对达成和平协议的困难以及俄罗斯对乌克兰日益猛烈的空袭感到沮丧。

"The president came on this morning and his view is that the obvious approach here is, let's all put on dramatic tariffs and keep the tariffs on until the Chinese agree to stop buying the oil. There really aren't many other places that oil can go," the first US official said.  
“总统今天早上来到这里，他的观点是，现在显而易见的做法是，让我们都征收高额关税，并且一直维持到中国同意停止购买石油为止。石油真的没有多少其他地方可以出口了，”第一位美国官员说。

Trump later on Tuesday told reporters he expected to have a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin "this week or early next week".  
特朗普周二晚些时候告诉记者，他预计将于“本周或下周初”与俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京通话。

The move by Trump comes after Chinese President Xi Jinping, Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi cemented their ties at a summit last week.  
特朗普此举是在中国国家主席习近平、俄罗斯总统普京和印度总理纳伦德拉·莫迪上周举行峰会巩固两国关系之后做出的。

The U.S. last month increased tariffs on Indian imports to 50 per cent due to the country's purchases of Russian oil, raising tensions with the South Asian nation.  
由于印度购买俄罗斯石油，美国上个月将印度进口产品的关税提高至 50%，这加剧了美国与这个南亚国家的紧张关系。

On Tuesday evening, Trump wrote on Truth Social that trade negotiations with India would proceed and suggested they would have a "successful conclusion".  
周二晚上，特朗普在“真相社交”上撰文称，与印度的贸易谈判将继续进行，并暗示谈判将“取得成功”。

"India, and the United States of America, are continuing negotiations to address the Trade Barriers between our two Nations. I look forward to speaking with my very good friend, Prime Minister Modi, in the upcoming weeks," he wrote.  
他写道：“印度和美国正在继续谈判，以解决两国之间的贸易壁垒。我期待在接下来的几周内与我的好朋友莫迪总理进行会谈。”

Washington has not specifically targeted China because of its purchases of Russian oil. In April, Trump sharply increased tariffs on Chinese imports but scaled them back in May after a severe market backlash.  
华盛顿并未因为中国购买俄罗斯石油而专门针对中国。今年4月，特朗普大幅提高了对中国进口商品的关税，但在市场强烈反应后，5月又降低了关税。

EU officials, led by the bloc's sanctions chief David O'Sullivan, participated in the discussions in Washington, which featured senior U.S. Treasury officials.  
由欧盟制裁事务负责人戴维·奥沙利文 (David O'Sullivan) 领导的欧盟官员与美国财政部高级官员一起参加了在华盛顿举行的讨论。

European capitals were discussing potential secondary sanctions against countries such as China and India for buying Russian oil and gas, officials told the Financial Times this week, but many are nervous given the EU's trade relations with Beijing and New Delhi.  
欧洲各国官员本周向英国《金融时报》表示，欧洲各国政府正在讨论对中国和印度等购买俄罗斯石油和天然气的国家实施二级制裁，但考虑到欧盟与北京和新德里的贸易关系，许多国家都感到紧张。

U.S. diplomats in Europe have stressed to EU capitals that the Trump administration is not willing to impose punitive measures on buyers of Russian oil and gas without the EU's participation. Some European countries also continue to purchase Russian energy products for themselves.  
美国驻欧洲外交官向欧盟各国政府强调，特朗普政府不愿在没有欧盟参与的情况下对俄罗斯石油和天然气买家实施惩罚措施。一些欧洲国家仍在继续购买俄罗斯能源产品。

"It's a question of, do the Europeans have the political will to bring the war to an end?" the first U.S. official said, adding: "Any of these things will of course be costly, and for the president to do it, we need our EU partners and ideally all of our partners with us. And we'll share the pain together."  
“问题是，欧洲人是否有结束战争的政治意愿？”第一位美国官员说道，并补充道：“任何这些措施当然都会付出高昂的代价，而总统要做到这一点，我们需要欧盟伙伴的支持，最好是所有伙伴的支持。我们将共同承担痛苦。”
