英国《金融时报》编辑鲁拉·哈拉夫 (Roula Khalaf) 在每周简报中挑选了她最喜欢的故事。

The EU has pledged to work on clean energy and climate action with US local authorities and businesses rather than focusing on the federal government, after President Donald Trump called climate change “the greatest con job ever” and pushed American industry to drill for more fossil fuels.  
在美国总统唐纳德·特朗普称气候变化是“有史以来最大的骗局”并敦促美国工业开采更多化石燃料后，欧盟承诺与美国地方当局和企业合作开展清洁能源和气候行动，而不是专注于联邦政府。

The US, the world’s second-largest greenhouse gas emitter, pulled out of the UN’s Paris climate agreement for the second time this year and has rapidly cut back funding for [clean energy](https://www.ft.com/renewable-energy), instead promising billions of dollars in subsidies to the oil and gas sector.  
美国是世界第二大温室气体排放国，今年第二次退出联合国《巴黎气候协定》，并迅速削减 [清洁能源](https://www.ft.com/renewable-energy) 资金，转而承诺向石油和天然气行业提供数十亿美元的补贴。

In a draft policy paper on climate diplomacy efforts seen by the Financial Times, the [European Commission](https://www.ft.com/stream/e0c4f5e5-5ecc-404a-a236-afde4624e372) said it would “co-operate with the US in the clean energy transition and on clean technologies”, notably with “subnational entities, business and think tanks”.  
英国《金融时报》看到的一份关于气候外交努力的政策文件草案中， [欧盟委员会](https://www.ft.com/stream/e0c4f5e5-5ecc-404a-a236-afde4624e372) 表示将“与美国在清洁能源转型和清洁技术方面进行合作”，特别是与“地方实体、企业和智库”进行合作。

The commitment comes in the face of [US efforts](https://www.ft.com/content/678f7c25-2eff-4e98-9c7c-e0772fa69236?syn-25a6b1a6=) to pressure the bloc into cutting back some of its most ambitious climate legislation, such as its deforestation law and its corporate sustainability due diligence directive, which orders large companies to unroot environmental and social abuses in their supply chains.  
欧盟做出这一承诺之际， [美国正努力](https://www.ft.com/content/678f7c25-2eff-4e98-9c7c-e0772fa69236?syn-25a6b1a6=) 向欧盟施压，要求其削减一些最雄心勃勃的气候立法，例如森林砍伐法和企业可持续性尽职调查指令，这些指令要求大公司消除其供应链中存在的环境和社会侵害行为。

The demands have been met with some resistance in Brussels, which is already undertaking efforts to simplify its green regulations.  
这些要求在布鲁塞尔遭遇了一些抵制，但布鲁塞尔已开始努力简化其绿色法规。

Several delegations [from American states](https://www.ft.com/content/5aeda50d-a3b5-4a20-97bd-75a22d7d061b) have visited Brussels in recent months to discuss initiatives, such as carbon pricing, as Democratic legislatures try to continue with efforts to combat climate change despite the policies of the Republican Trump administration.  
近几个月来， [美国多个州的](https://www.ft.com/content/5aeda50d-a3b5-4a20-97bd-75a22d7d061b) 代表团访问了布鲁塞尔，讨论碳定价等举措。尽管共和党政府采取了这些政策，但民主党立法机构仍试图继续努力应对气候变化。

The EU’s draft paper, due to be published on Thursday, sets out the ways in which the EU will use its diplomatic heft to advance the clean energy transition worldwide, including by helping countries establish their own carbon markets and using its development aid arm to invest in “large flagship projects” such as renewable energy plants in developing nations.  
欧盟的草案将于周四发布，其中阐述了欧盟将如何利用其外交影响力推动全球清洁能源转型，包括帮助各国建立自己的碳市场，以及利用其发展援助部门投资“大型旗舰项目”，例如发展中国家的可再生能源工厂。

It also says that it will use its development aid programme to help countries cope with the effects of its carbon border tax, which businesses will have to start paying from next year and several major trading partners including India and China have criticised.  
它还表示将利用其发展援助计划帮助各国应对碳边境税的影响，企业将从明年开始缴纳碳边境税，印度和中国等几个主要贸易伙伴对此提出了批评。

Funding would “help alleviate concerns raised on EU legislation as well as strengthen partnerships and support broader regulatory reforms”, the document said.

It also announced that the bloc would launch a “clean transition business council” to advise the commission on cleantech investment opportunities abroad and appoint a “special co-ordinator for the global clean transition” to similarly promote EU cleantech companies.

“We are being way more transactional in the way that we do business and the way that we do climate and diplomacy,” an EU official said.

The main objectives of the document were to set out how the EU would “help countries with the clean transition” but also how it would reduce its dependency on countries such as China for natural resources, the official said.

The EU has one of the most ambitious climate agendas in the world but is facing an increasing backlash from businesses and rightwing politicians who argue that the bloc has gone too far, too fast and that the level of green regulation is stifling growth.

Conservative lawmakers argue that the bloc, which accounts for 6 per cent of global emissions, must do more to encourage others to cut emissions at the same rate.

In a news conference last week, Manfred Weber, leader of the conservative European People’s Party, told journalists that China and Brazil “were not as ambitious as we would like to see them” when it came to their own climate goals.

The commission declined to comment on the document, which could be subject to change before it is presented.
