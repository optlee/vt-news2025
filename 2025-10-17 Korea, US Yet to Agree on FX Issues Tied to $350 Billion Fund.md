South Korea remains in intensive talks with the US to iron out final details of its $350 billion investment pledge, including a possible currency swap line aimed at safeguarding the Asian nation from potential financial instability.  
韩国仍在与美国进行密集谈判，以敲定 3500 亿美元投资承诺的最终细节，其中包括可能的货币互换额度，旨在保护这个亚洲国家免受潜在的金融不稳定的影响。

Several senior officials from Seoul, including presidential policy chief Kim Yong-beom and Trade Minister Yeo Han-koo, are in Washington this week seeking to finalize the agreement before the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit later this month. Policy Chief Kim also met with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and other US officials during the visit.  
本周，包括总统政策首席金永范和贸易部长吕汉求在内的多名首尔高级官员正在华盛顿，寻求在本月晚些时候举行的亚太经合组织峰会前敲定该协议。金永范访问期间还会见了商务部长霍华德·卢特尼克和其他美国官员。

The trade talks have been in deadlock for more than two months, with the two countries divided over the implementation of the $350 billion investment fund. The investment pledge is the centerpiece of a trade agreement that capped US duties on Korean goods at 15%. With the details still unresolved, the US has yet to lower tariffs on cars from 25%, leaving South Korean automakers at a disadvantage against their Japanese rivals.  
贸易谈判陷入僵局已逾两个月，两国在3500亿美元投资基金的实施问题上存在分歧。这项投资承诺是贸易协定的核心内容，该协定规定美国对韩国商品的关税上限为15%。由于细节问题尚未解决，美国尚未将汽车关税从25%下调，这使得韩国汽车制造商在与日本竞争对手的竞争中处于劣势。

President Donald Trump has repeatedly insisted that Seoul’s investment package be made “upfront.” South Korea pushed back, arguing that the amount represents more than 80% of its foreign exchange reserves. Officials warned that such an outflow could weaken the won and have pressed the US to establish a currency swap arrangement.  
唐纳德·特朗普总统一再坚持要求首尔的投资计划“预付”。韩国对此予以反驳，称这笔资金占其外汇储备的80%以上。官员们警告称，这种资金外流可能会削弱韩元，并已敦促美国建立货币互换安排。

With exports equivalent to over 40% of South Korea’s GDP, the finalized trade deal is expected to provide greater stability and confidence in its economy.  
由于出口占韩国 GDP 的 40%以上，最终达成的贸易协议预计将为韩国经济带来更大的稳定性和信心。

Finance Minister Koo Yun-cheol said he had conveyed to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that making the investment upfront in cash would not be feasible given Korea’s foreign-exchange constraints.  
韩国企划财政部长官具润哲表示，他已向财政部长斯科特·贝森特转达了这一信息，考虑到韩国的外汇限制，预先以现金进行投资并不可行。

“Once an alternative structure is proposed, we’ll assess the associated FX demand and whether it can be managed within a range that ensures stability in Korea’s currency market,” Koo told reporters in Washington during a televised interview. “Depending on how that changes, we’ll then determine whether a currency swap is necessary, whether it’s feasible, and if so, to what extent it should be pursued.”  
“一旦提出替代结构，我们将评估相关的外汇需求，以及它是否能够控制在确保韩国货币市场稳定的范围内，”具朝阳在华盛顿接受电视采访时告诉记者。“我们将根据情况变化，确定货币互换是否必要、是否可行，以及如果可行，应该在多大程度上进行。”

The Munhwa Ilbo newspaper earlier [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/T47GUFGPWCG0) that Korea is in discussions with the US on an Argentina-style currency swap to help curb volatility in its FX market. The arrangement would likely be made through US Treasury funding, rather than a direct deal between the Federal Reserve and the [Bank of Korea](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/1206Z:KS), the report said.  
《文化日报》此前 [报道称，](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/T47GUFGPWCG0) 韩国正在与美国商讨类似阿根廷的货币互换协议，以帮助抑制韩国外汇市场的波动。报道称，该协议可能通过美国财政部融资进行，而非美联储和 [韩国央行](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/1206Z:KS) 之间的直接交易。

Policy Chief Kim also visited the US Office of Management and Budget on Thursday to discuss a shipbuilding initiative known as “Make American Shipbuilding Great Again,” according to Yonhap News.  
据韩联社报道，政策主管金正恩周四还访问了美国管理和预算办公室，讨论一项名为“让美国造船业再次伟大”的造船计划。

His visit comes after China [sanctioned](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-14/china-imposes-curbs-on-hanwha-units-after-us-shipping-moves) the US unit of South Korean shipbuilding giant Hanwha Ocean Co., and threatened further retaliatory measures against the industry. The US State Department condemned China’s actions as an “irresponsible attempt” to disrupt shipbuilding cooperation between Korea and the US, Yonhap [reported](https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20251017000700315 "Yonhap").  
此前，中国对韩国造船巨头韩华远洋株式会社的美国子公司 [实施制裁](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-14/china-imposes-curbs-on-hanwha-units-after-us-shipping-moves) ，并威胁将对该行业采取进一步的报复措施。据韩联社 [报道](https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20251017000700315 "Yonhap") ，美国国务院谴责中国此举是“不负责任的企图”，旨在破坏韩美之间的造船合作。
