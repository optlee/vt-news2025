Elliott Management has become a top three shareholder of Kansai Electric Power, Japan’s second-largest utility and a major nuclear power operator, in a sign that activist investors in the country feel emboldened to take positions in sectors considered sensitive.  
埃利奥特管理公司已成为日本第二大公用事业公司和主要核电运营商关西电力的前三大股东之一，这一迹象表明，日本的激进投资者有勇气在被视为敏感的领域占据一席之地。

The New York-based activist fund now owns between 4 and 5 per cent of the company, according to people familiar with the stake. That would make [Elliott](https://www.ft.com/stream/f01508e4-81ac-4144-aade-36624c66c926) a top three shareholder, based on share data from Kansai Electric.  
据知情人士透露，这家总部位于纽约的激进基金目前持有该公司 4%至 5%的股份。根据关西电力的股票数据，这意味着 [埃利奥特](https://www.ft.com/stream/f01508e4-81ac-4144-aade-36624c66c926) 将成为该公司的前三大股东之一。

Elliott is pushing the company to increase dividends and share buybacks by selling ¥150bn ($1bn) a year of non-core assets, according to the people.  
据知情人士透露，埃利奥特正通过每年出售 1500 亿日元（10 亿美元）的非核心资产来推动该公司增加股息和股票回购。

They said the fund believed [Kansai Electric](https://www.ft.com/stream/87fe1e29-23a9-4851-867f-f9dd3099ade0), which has a market capitalisation of ¥2.4tn, was sitting on more than ¥2tn of non-core assets, including a large stake in a construction company and more than ¥1tn in property, according to Elliott’s valuations.  
他们表示，根据埃利奥特的估值，该基金认为 [关西电力](https://www.ft.com/stream/87fe1e29-23a9-4851-867f-f9dd3099ade0) （市值 2.4 万亿日元）拥有超过 2 万亿日元的非核心资产，包括一家建筑公司的大量股份和超过 1 万亿日元的房地产。

Kansai Electric shares jumped more than 8 per cent on Wednesday morning in Tokyo after news of the stake was published.  
关西电力入股的消息公布后，其股价于周三上午在东京上涨逾 8%。

Japan is in the middle of a corporate governance reform push backed by politicians and regulators that has put companies under increasing pressure to justify their non-core businesses and assets.  
日本正处于由政界人士和监管机构支持的公司治理改革阶段，这使得企业面临越来越大的压力，需要证明其非核心业务和资产的合理性。

While activists have targeted a broad swath of industrial sectors, Elliott’s stake represents its first foray into Japan’s nuclear power sector, considered sensitive because of the country’s need to build up its energy independence.  
尽管激进投资者瞄准了广泛的工业领域，但埃利奥特的入股代表其首次涉足日本核电领域，由于日本需要建立能源独立性，该领域被视为敏感领域。

The people familiar with Elliott’s thinking said the fund believed Kansai Electric, which serves an industrial region that includes Kyoto and Osaka, could improve its operations and margins by raising prices for some larger corporate customers, while using its low-cost nuclear power to attract investment to the area.  
熟悉埃利奥特想法的人士表示，该基金认为，关西电力公司服务于包括京都和大阪在内的工业区，可以通过提高一些大型企业客户的价格来改善运营和利润率，同时利用其低成本的核电来吸引对该地区的投资。

The company, which made ¥420.4bn in profit in the fiscal year to March, is already part of a joint venture with CyrusOne to supply power to a data centre being built in the Kansai region.  
该公司在截至 3 月份的财年中实现了 4204 亿日元的利润，并已与 CyrusOne 成立合资企业，为关西地区正在建设的数据中心提供电力。

Kansai Electric declined to comment on the Elliott stake but said it intended to continue engaging in careful communication with its shareholders. Elliott declined to comment.  
关西电力拒绝就埃利奥特股份发表评论，但表示打算继续与股东进行谨慎沟通。埃利奥特拒绝置评。

Activists have had difficulty taking on Japan’s utilities. In 2008, the UK hedge fund Children’s Investment Fund Management, also known as TCI, sold its stake in J-Power after broad opposition from the media and government culminated in shareholders rejecting its proposals for higher dividends and management changes.  
激进投资者在收购日本公用事业公司方面一直举步维艰。2008 年，英国对冲基金儿童投资基金管理公司（Children's Investment Fund Management，简称 TCI）出售了其在 J-Power 的股份，此前该公司遭到媒体和政府的广泛反对，最终导致股东否决了提高股息和管理变革的提议。

Since then, major activists have largely avoided the sector until last November, when Elliott unveiled a more than [5 per cent position in Tokyo Gas](https://www.ft.com/content/6d05db87-d456-4337-a1a8-951d126af374).  
自此以后，大型激进投资者大多避开该行业，直到去年 11 月，埃利奥特才披露其 [持有东京燃气 5% 以上的股份](https://www.ft.com/content/6d05db87-d456-4337-a1a8-951d126af374) 。

After Elliott’s campaign, the company put in place a midterm plan involving ¥120bn in near-term buybacks, a dividend increase and ¥100bn in property sales. Its share price has risen by close to 50 per cent, compared with a roughly 15 per cent gain for the benchmark Topix. Tokyo Gas now trades at a premium to book value.  
在埃利奥特的行动之后，该公司制定了一项中期计划，包括1200亿日元的短期回购、增加股息以及1000亿日元的房地产出售。其股价已上涨近50%，而同期基准东证股价指数的涨幅约为15%。东京燃气目前的股价高于账面价值。

The people familiar with Elliott’s thinking said the fund hoped to repeat the feat with Kansai Electric, whose shares until Wednesday had fallen 13 per cent on the year, including a sharp 20 per cent drop in November after an equity offering.

They added that Elliott believed the company had a strong enough balance sheet to return capital to shareholders while investing in its core business.

Kansai Electric — which along with thermal and renewable energy plants owns 11 nuclear reactors, seven of which are operating — this year became Japan’s first utility to move towards building the first new reactor since the 2011 Fukushima disaster. In total, 14 reactors have restarted in Japan.
