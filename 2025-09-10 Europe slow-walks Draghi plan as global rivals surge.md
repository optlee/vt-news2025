A year after former Italian PM’s report on competitiveness, EU implements just 11% of his ideas

The EU has implemented just a fraction of the proposals made by former Italian premier Mario Draghi on revitalising the bloc’s flagging economy in the race against global rivals such as China and the US.  
在与中国和美国等全球竞争对手的竞争中，欧盟仅实施了意大利前总理马里奥·德拉吉提出的振兴欧盟低迷经济的建议的一小部分。

Back in September 2024, [Draghi set out 383 recommendations](https://www.ft.com/content/92f7aedd-67fa-488f-8559-7019b7c2e40a) warning that Europe faced an “existential challenge” and would “not be able to become a leader in new technologies, a beacon of climate responsibility and an independent player on the world stage” unless it became more productive.  
早在 2024 年 9 月， [德拉吉就提出了 383 条建议，](https://www.ft.com/content/92f7aedd-67fa-488f-8559-7019b7c2e40a) 警告称，欧洲面临“生存挑战”，除非提高生产力，否则“将无法成为新技术的领导者、气候责任的灯塔和世界舞台上的独立参与者”。

But a year on, despite the European Commission’s pledges to move quickly, only 11.2 per cent of Draghi’s ideas have been implemented, according to an audit by the European Policy Innovation Council, a Brussels-based think-tank.  
但根据布鲁塞尔智库欧洲政策创新委员会的审计结果，一年过去了，尽管欧盟委员会承诺迅速采取行动，但德拉吉的想法只有 11.2% 得到了实施。

Meanwhile, Europe’s economy has continued to flatline, with the US economy expanding eight times faster than the EU’s in the second quarter of 2025, according to Eurostat data.  
与此同时，欧洲经济继续持平，根据欧盟统计局的数据，2025 年第二季度美国经济的增长速度是欧盟的八倍。

EU officials argue that European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, who had tasked Draghi to write his report, has been too preoccupied with averting a full-blown trade war with the US, keeping the Trump administration engaged on Ukraine and striking the right balance with China.  
欧盟官员认为，委托德拉吉撰写报告的欧盟委员会主席乌尔苏拉·冯德莱恩过于专注于避免与美国爆发全面贸易战、让特朗普政府参与乌克兰问题并与中国取得适当的平衡。

National leaders in Europe have also been reluctant to set aside their countries’ sensitivities and embrace more of the former European Central Bank president’s proposals.  
欧洲各国领导人也不愿意抛开国家敏感性，更多地接受这位前欧洲央行行长的提议。

The competitiveness agenda seems blocked, said one EU diplomat. “The commission is trying, but ultimately it depends on national leaders. Meanwhile, we are losing time.”  
一位欧盟外交官表示，竞争力议程似乎受阻。“欧盟委员会正在努力，但最终还是要取决于各国领导人。与此同时，我们正在浪费时间。”

Most of the progress made has been in areas of least resistance, such as joint borrowing for defence, or slashing red tape, according to Deutsche Bank analysts.  
德意志银行分析师表示，大部分进展都发生在阻力最小的领域，例如国防联合借款或削减繁文缛节。

“So far we would not describe as game changers any of the proposals that they have done,” said Marion Mühlberger, senior economist at Deutsche Bank.  
德意志银行高级经济学家马里恩·米尔伯格表示：“到目前为止，我们不会将他们提出的任何建议描述为改变游戏规则的举措。”

A [commission](https://www.ft.com/stream/e0c4f5e5-5ecc-404a-a236-afde4624e372) spokesperson defended the commission’s record, saying it had “acted quickly to implement \[Draghi’s\] key recommendations”, noting support for AI gigafactories, cleantech manufacturing and strategies to grow private capital investment.  
[欧盟委员会](https://www.ft.com/stream/e0c4f5e5-5ecc-404a-a236-afde4624e372) 发言人为委员会的记录进行辩护，称其“迅速采取行动实施（德拉吉的）关键建议”，并指出支持人工智能超级工厂、清洁技术制造和增加私人资本投资的战略。

In her annual address to the European parliament on Wednesday, von der Leyen will tout the headway made so far and call for more steps, which have become more pressing given the oscillating transatlantic relationship under President Donald Trump.  
冯德莱恩将于周三在欧洲议会发表年度讲话，届时她将重点介绍迄今为止取得的进展，并呼吁采取更多措施。鉴于唐纳德·特朗普总统领导下的跨大西洋关系动荡不安，这些措施变得更加紧迫。

| Category 类别 | % of total 占总数的百分比 | Number of measures 措施数量 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Implemented 实施的 | 11.2% | 43 |
| Partially implemented 部分实施 | 20.1% | 77 |
| In progress 进行中 | 46.0% | 176 |
| Not implemented 未实施 | 22.7% | 176 |
| Total | 100% | 176 |

But outstanding projects remain elusive, such as the establishment of a capital markets union, eliminating barriers in the single market and harmonising more rules that drive up the cost of business.  
但尚未完成的项目仍然难以实现，例如建立资本市场联盟、消除单一市场的障碍以及协调更多推高商业成本的规则。

Stéphane Séjourné, the EU’s industry commissioner, blamed member states for the lack of progress, particularly on the EU’s single market.  
欧盟工业事务专员斯特凡·塞茹尔内 (Stéphane Séjourné) 将欧盟单一市场建设缺乏进展归咎于成员国。

One EU law should replace 27 national laws, making it easier for businesses to operate in the bloc, he said. “When we say that, on paper everyone is in agreement,” he told lawmakers last week. But when the decision reaches EU governments “there is opposition”.  
他说，一部欧盟法律应该取代27部国家法律，使企业在欧盟境内运营更加便捷。“当我们这样说的时候，纸面上大家都同意，”他上周告诉议员们。但当这项决定传到欧盟各国政府手中时，“却遭到了反对”。

Governments are protective of their national rules, said Oscar Guinea of the European Centre for International Political Economy (ECIPE), who argues for more harmonisation in the services sector, as Draghi recommended. The “lack of a single market for services stops the adoption of digital technology and the appearance of digital companies”, he said.  
欧洲国际政治经济中心（ECIPE）的奥斯卡·几内亚（Oscar Guinea）表示，各国政府都在维护本国规则。他主张服务业应该加强协调，正如德拉吉所建议的那样。“缺乏单一的服务市场阻碍了数字技术的采用和数字化公司的出现，”他说道。

National leaders in October will discuss competitiveness, said António Costa, the EU Council president who is chairing the meeting. He told the FT that the summit will be “a very important moment” to push for a capital markets union, the digital euro and how to strengthen the international role of the single currency.  
主持此次会议的欧盟理事会主席安东尼奥·科斯塔表示，各国领导人将于10月讨论竞争力问题。他告诉英国《金融时报》，此次峰会将是推动建立资本市场联盟、数字欧元以及如何加强单一货币国际地位的“一个非常重要的时刻”。

In January, Brussels published a ‘’, that distilled Draghi’s principles into priority areas such as joint purchases of critical raw materials and reviewing capital requirements to free up bank investments.  
今年一月，布鲁塞尔发布了一份《》，将德拉吉的原则提炼为优先领域，例如联合采购关键原材料和审查资本要求以释放银行投资。

But the commission has shied away from pressing for the most radical of Draghi’s demands such as joint funding for key strategic industries and common infrastructure.  
但欧盟委员会一直回避德拉吉提出的最激进的要求，例如对关键战略产业和共同基础设施的联合资助。

Its major focus has been on “simplification and deregulation”, said Bas Eickhout, co-leader of the Greens in the EU parliament. “This commission has not done enough on competitiveness because they have chosen a very narrow definition of competitiveness, which I don’t think is the biggest problem of Europe. Yes we are bureaucratic but lack of investment is Europe’s biggest problem”.  
欧洲议会绿党联合领导人巴斯·艾克豪特表示，欧盟委员会的主要重点是“简化和放松管制”。“这个委员会在竞争力方面做得不够，因为他们对竞争力的定义非常狭隘，我认为这并非欧洲最大的问题。没错，我们确实存在官僚主义，但缺乏投资才是欧洲最大的问题。”

In her first term, the von der Leyen commission increased legislative output by 17 per cent compared with her predecessor, according to Financial Times analysis. The rise was mostly driven by an increase in secondary legislation — detailed rules that descend into technical detail over the application of EU laws.  
据《金融时报》分析，冯德莱恩委员会在其第一任期内，立法产出较其前任增加了17%。这一增长主要得益于次级立法的增加——这些详细规则涉及欧盟法律应用的技术细节。

But von der Leyen’s second-term efforts to cut red tape, as recommended by [Draghi](https://www.ft.com/stream/7a22425a-56a3-4983-b479-7478583bc242), has in some cases created more uncertainty for industry — packaging various pieces of legislation in “omnibus bills” and replacing complex regulations with simplified versions which are often scant on detail.  
但冯德莱恩在第二任期内按照 [德拉吉](https://www.ft.com/stream/7a22425a-56a3-4983-b479-7478583bc242) 的建议削减繁文缛节的努力，在某些情况下给行业带来了更多不确定性——将各种立法打包成“综合法案”，并用往往缺乏细节的简化版本取代复杂的法规。

For Sander Tordoir, chief economist at the Centre for European Reform, simplification is a sideshow rather than the main medication.  
对于欧洲改革中心首席经济学家桑德·托尔多尔来说，简化只是一种配角，而不是主要手段。

“You can have a bonfire of regulations and if you have none of the other policies Draghi recommended... nothing is going to happen.”  
“如果你不采取德拉吉建议的其他政策，那么即使出台了一堆法规，什么也不会发生。”
