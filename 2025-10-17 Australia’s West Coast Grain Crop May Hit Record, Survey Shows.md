Western Australia, the nation’s biggest grain-producing state, may harvest a record-breaking crop this year thanks to strong weather and a shift from livestock to cropping, potentially exacerbating a global wheat glut.  
西澳大利亚州是澳大利亚最大的粮食生产州，由于天气条件恶劣以及从畜牧业到种植业的转变，该州今年的产量可能创历史新高，这可能会加剧全球小麦供过于求的局面。

The 2025 harvest could reach 25.5 million tons, nearly half of which would be wheat, according to a survey in the Grain Industry Association of Western Australia’s October report. That represents an upgrade on [the September estimates](https://www.giwa.org.au/wa-crop-reports/2025-season/giwa-crop-report-september-2025/ "GIWA") and only slightly below the [2022 record crop](https://www.giwa.org.au/wa-crop-reports/2022-season/giwa-crop-report-february-2023/ "GIWA"), which came in just over 26 million tons.  
根据西澳大利亚谷物产业协会 10 月份报告中的一项调查，2025 年的产量可能达到 2550 万吨，其中近一半将是小麦。这比 [9 月份的预测](https://www.giwa.org.au/wa-crop-reports/2025-season/giwa-crop-report-september-2025/ "GIWA") 有所上调，仅略低于 [2022 年的创纪录产量](https://www.giwa.org.au/wa-crop-reports/2022-season/giwa-crop-report-february-2023/ "GIWA") （略高于 2600 万吨）。

GIWA said the shift away from sheep herding toward cultivating wheat, barley, canola and other grains had helped boost yields, as well as positive weather across the state. Concerns in the September report around the potential for spring frost damaging the harvest had failed to materialize, the authors said.  
GIWA 表示，从牧羊业转向种植小麦、大麦、油菜籽和其他谷物有助于提高产量，而且全州气候条件良好。作者表示，9 月份报告中关于春季霜冻可能损害收成的担忧并未出现。

“In the higher rainfall zones, as more farmers get out of sheep there has been a significant shift from pasture to crop and the cropped area has increased by about 15% in the last four years,” the association said.  
该协会表示：“在降雨量较高的地区，随着越来越多的农民不再饲养绵羊，牧场种植面积已显著转向种植作物，过去四年种植面积增加了约 15%。”

Australia is a major exporter of wheat and barley to Asian economies, including Indonesia, Thailand and China, where it is used in everything from noodles to bread. However, prices are struggling in the midst of a global oversupply, with a positive outlook for wheat crops across all major exporting nations sending US futures to their lowest in five years over the past month.  
澳大利亚是向印度尼西亚、泰国和中国等亚洲经济体出口小麦和大麦的主要国家，小麦被用于制作从面条到面包的各种食品。然而，在全球供应过剩的背景下，小麦价格举步维艰。所有主要出口国小麦作物前景乐观，导致美国小麦期货价格在过去一个月跌至五年来的最低点。
