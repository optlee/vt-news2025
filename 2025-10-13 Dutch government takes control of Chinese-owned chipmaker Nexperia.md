The Dutch government has taken control of Nexperia, a Chinese-owned but Netherlands-based semiconductor maker, to try to ensure enough of its chips stay in Europe for the automotive and consumer electronics industries.  
荷兰政府已接管总部位于荷兰的中国半导体制造商 Nexperia，以确保其有足够的芯片留在欧洲，供汽车和消费电子行业使用。

For the first time, The Hague has used its Goods Availability Act because of “a threat to the continuity and safeguarding on Dutch and European soil of crucial technological knowledge and capabilities”, the ministry of economic affairs said in a statement on Sunday.  
海牙经济事务部周日在一份声明中表示，由于“对荷兰和欧洲领土上关键技术知识和能力的连续性和保障构成威胁”，海牙首次动用了《货物可用性法案》。

A state-backed Chinese investment consortium acquired Nexperia for $2.75bn in 2017 after it was carved out of NXP Semiconductors, a Dutch chip manufacturer. The following year, the consortium began selling its shares to Chinese technology group Wingtech, which became Nexperia’s majority owner in 2019.  
2017 年，一家由中国政府支持的投资财团以 27.5 亿美元收购了 Nexperia，该公司最初由荷兰芯片制造商恩智浦半导体（NXP Semiconductors）分拆而来。次年，该财团开始将其持有的股份出售给中国科技集团闻泰科技（Wingtech），后者于 2019 年成为 Nexperia 的大股东。

The move escalates frictions between western countries and China over [access to high-end technology](https://www.ft.com/content/ce034c1b-97bd-4a79-a4e0-c62cf91aa233) such as advanced semiconductors and critical raw materials. On Thursday, China [placed sweeping restrictions](https://www.ft.com/content/c4b2c5d9-c82f-401e-b763-bc9581019cb7) on the exports of rare earths used in products from cars to wind turbines.  
此举加剧了西方国家与中国在先进半导体等 [高端技术和关键原材料方面的](https://www.ft.com/content/ce034c1b-97bd-4a79-a4e0-c62cf91aa233) 摩擦。周四，中国对从汽车到风力涡轮机等产品中使用的稀土出口 [实施了全面限制](https://www.ft.com/content/c4b2c5d9-c82f-401e-b763-bc9581019cb7) 。

The Dutch ministry statement said that it had acted because of “serious governance shortcomings and actions” at Nexperia.  
荷兰政府部门的声明称，该部门采取这一行动是因为 Nexperia 存在“严重的治理缺陷和行为”。

“The decision aims to prevent a situation in which the goods produced by Nexperia (finished and semi-finished products) would become unavailable in an emergency,” it added. “Nexperia produces, among other things, chips used in the European automotive industry and in consumer electronics.”  
“该决定旨在防止 Nexperia 生产的商品（成品和半成品）在紧急情况下出现断货的情况，”该公司补充道。“Nexperia 生产的芯片等产品用于欧洲汽车工业和消费电子产品。”

Vincent Karremans, the Dutch economy minister, can now block or reverse decisions taken by Nexperia’s board. His department acted on September 30 but only made its move public on October 12.  
荷兰经济部长文森特·卡雷曼斯（Vincent Karremans）现在可以阻止或推翻 Nexperia 董事会做出的决定。他的部门于 9 月 30 日采取了行动，但直到 10 月 12 日才公布这一决定。

Wingtech, which started as a contract manufacturer for smartphones, said in a statement that the decision “constitutes an act of excessive interference driven by geopolitical bias, not by fact-based risk assessment”.  
闻泰科技最初是一家智能手机代工制造商，该公司在一份声明中表示，该决定“是一种出于地缘政治偏见而非基于事实的风险评估而进行的过度干涉行为”。

It added: “This move gravely contravenes the European Union’s long-standing advocacy for market-economy principles, fair competition, and international trade norms.”  
声明还称：“此举严重违反了欧盟长期以来倡导的市场经济原则、公平竞争和国际贸易规范。”

The company said in stock exchange filings that it had appealed to the Chinese government for assistance and detailed the change in control at Nexperia. Wingtech’s shares in Shanghai fell by the maximum 10 per cent on Monday.  
该公司在提交给证券交易所的文件中表示，已向中国政府寻求帮助，并详细说明了安世半导体的控制权变更情况。闻泰科技的股票在上海证券交易所周一跌幅达10%，创历史新高。

Wingtech said that on September 30 the Dutch government had issued an order requiring Nexperia and its global subsidiaries, branches, and offices not to make any adjustments to their assets, intellectual property, business operations or personnel for one year.  
闻泰科技称，9 月 30 日，荷兰政府已发布命令，要求 Nexperia 及其全球子公司、分公司和办事处一年内不得对其资产、知识产权、业务运营或人员进行任何调整。

The following day, three top Nexperia executives with Dutch and German nationalities submitted an emergency request to the Amsterdam court of appeal to intervene at the chipmaker. The court immediately suspended the powers of Chinese chief executive Zhang Xuezheng.  
第二天，三名拥有荷兰和德国国籍的 Nexperia 高管向阿姆斯特丹上诉法院提交了紧急请求，要求对该芯片制造商进行干预。法院立即暂停了中国首席执行官张学政的权力。

The court also suspended Zhang from his positions as executive director of Nexperia and non-executive director of its holding company, Wingtech said.  
闻泰科技表示，法院还暂停了张先生担任 Nexperia 执行董事及其控股公司非执行董事的职务。

A week later, on October 7, the court ordered the appointment of an independent, non-Chinese director, who would hold decisive voting power and represent Nexperia.  
一周后，即 10 月 7 日，法院下令任命一名独立的非中国董事，该董事将拥有决定性的投票权并代表 Nexperia。

The court also ordered all shares in Nexperia — except one — would be placed under custodial management by a designated individual, not yet named, for management purposes, Wingtech said.  
闻泰科技表示，法院还下令将 Nexperia 的所有股份（除一股外）交由指定个人托管管理，但具体名称尚未确定。

Washington last year added Wingtech to its “entity list”, accusing the company of helping China acquire sensitive semiconductor manufacturing technology. The designation requires US companies to seek a licence to sell to them. Those licence requests are often denied.  
华盛顿去年将闻泰科技列入“实体名单”，指控该公司帮助中国获取敏感的半导体制造技术。这项规定要求美国公司必须获得许可才能向其出售产品。这些许可申请经常被拒绝。

The US commerce department last month introduced new rules that extend the sales restrictions to subsidiaries of companies on the entity list, meaning that Nexperia would be subject to restrictions because of its Wingtech ownership.  
美国商务部上个月出台了新规定，将销售限制扩大到实体名单上的公司的子公司，这意味着 Nexperia 将因其对闻泰科技的所有权而受到限制。

The Chinese commerce ministry on Sunday listed the US action as one of the reasons it had imposed the broader rare earth restrictions.  
中国商务部周日将美国的行动列为实施更广泛稀土限制措施的原因之一。

Nexperia is based in Nijmegen but has subsidiaries across the world. The company said it “complies with all existing laws and regulations, export controls and sanctions regimes”.  
Nexperia 总部位于奈梅亨，但在世界各地设有子公司。该公司表示，“遵守所有现行法律法规、出口管制和制裁制度”。

In November 2022, [Nexperia was blocked from buying Newport Wafer Fab](https://www.ft.com/content/cdaddf62-72f7-4789-890c-69f1ce196748) in the UK over national security concerns related to the Dutch company being owned by Wingtech.  
2022 年 11 月， [Nexperia 因被闻泰科技收购而引发国家安全担忧，被禁止收购英国纽波特晶圆厂 (Newport Wafer Fab)](https://www.ft.com/content/cdaddf62-72f7-4789-890c-69f1ce196748) 。

Under US pressure, The Hague has already restricted the sale by Dutch group ASML of advanced semiconductor-manufacturing machines to China.  
在美国的压力下，海牙已经限制荷兰阿斯麦集团向中国出售先进的半导体制造机器。

The ministry said its latest action was not “directed at other companies, the sector, or other countries” and that “parties may lodge an objection to this decision before the courts”.  
该部表示，其最新行动并非“针对其他公司、该行业或其他国家”，并且“各方可就该决定向法院提出异议”。
