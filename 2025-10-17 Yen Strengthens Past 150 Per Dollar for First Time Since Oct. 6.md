### Takeaways by Bloomberg AI彭博人工智能的要点

	政治不确定性削弱了日本央行本月加息的预期，但行长上田一夫表示，如果对实现经济前景的信心增强，该行将继续收紧政策。

The yen briefly strengthened past the 150 level against the dollar, bouncing back from its weakest point in eight months as bad loans at two US banks drove global demand for haven assets.  
由于两家美国银行的不良贷款推动了全球对避险资产的需求，日元兑美元汇率一度突破 150 关口，从八个月来的最低点反弹。

Japan’s currency outperformed most of its Group-of-10 peers on Friday, advancing as much as 0.4% to 149.90 versus the dollar, its strongest since Oct. 6. It traded at 150.10 as of 1:10 p.m. in Tokyo.  
周五，日元兑美元汇率跑赢多数十国集团货币，上涨 0.4%，至 149.90，为 10 月 6 日以来的最高水平。截至东京时间下午 1:10，日元兑美元汇率为 150.10。

The Swiss Franc also gained, while the US currency and Treasury yields were [dragged down](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/T49ABWGPWCHL) amid the selloff in regional bank shares.  
瑞士法郎也上涨，而美元和美国国债收益率则 [受到拖累](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/T49ABWGPWCHL) 在地区银行股票遭抛售的背景下。

The yen hit its weakest level since February a week ago after the victory of Sanae Takaichi as leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, then whipsawed after the shock collapse of Japan’s ruling coalition.  
一周前，高市早苗当选自民党总裁后，日元跌至二月份以来的最低水平，随后在日本执政联盟突然垮台后，日元汇率大幅下跌。

“Dollar-yen extended its decline, tracking UST yields lower amid risk-off sentiment,” said Christopher Wong, currency strategist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. “Focus is also on coalition formation in Japan, in particular whether the LDP and Japan Innovation Party manage to strike a deal.”  
华侨银行外汇策略师 Christopher Wong 表示：“在避险情绪的推动下，美元兑日元延续跌势，追随美国国债收益率走低。市场还关注日本执政联盟的组建，尤其是自民党和日本维新党能否达成协议。”

Political uncertainty has damped expectations that the Bank of Japan will lift rates this month. Still, Governor Kazuo Ueda [told](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-16/boj-s-ueda-keeps-door-open-for-rate-hike-as-policy-meeting-looms) reporters Thursday in Washington that the bank will continue tightening if confidence in achieving its economic outlook strengthens — keeping the door open for a near-term interest-rate hike.  
政治不确定性削弱了日本央行本月加息的预期。不过，日本央行行长上田和夫周四在华盛顿对记者 [表示](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-16/boj-s-ueda-keeps-door-open-for-rate-hike-as-policy-meeting-looms) ，如果对实现经济前景的信心增强，央行将继续收紧货币政策——这为近期加息留下了空间。

> FX traders looking back to 2023 will note that USD/JPY dropped around 800 pips from high to low during the regional banking fallout. Something similar this time around would imply the pair falling toward this month’s nadir on a 146 handle.  
> 回顾2023年的外汇交易员会注意到，在地区银行业危机的影响下，美元/日元从高点跌至低点约800点。此次出现类似情况，则意味着该货币对将跌向本月146点的低点。
> 
> The key driver again is plunging Treasury yields, with the 2-year down to levels last seen three years ago. And there’s plenty of room to overshoot on the downside as traders price for the Fed’s target rate to reach the 3% area.  
> 关键驱动因素再次是美国国债收益率暴跌，两年期国债收益率已跌至三年前的最低水平。由于交易员预计美联储目标利率将达到3%左右，因此下行空间仍然很大。
