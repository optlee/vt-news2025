SINGAPORE (Reuters) -- NIO stock plunged more than 13% on Thursday, on course for its biggest one-day drop in about six months, as investors fretted over the Chinese electric vehicle maker's outlook amid a U.S. securities lawsuit by Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC.  
新加坡（路透社）——蔚来汽车股价周四暴跌逾 13%，有望创下约六个月来的最大单日跌幅，原因是新加坡主权财富基金新加坡政府投资公司 (GIC) 在美国提起证券诉讼，导致投资者对这家中国电动汽车制造商的前景感到担忧。

The stock fell as far as HK$47 ($6.05), its lowest since Sept. 11, and was the biggest percentage loser on Hong Kong's Hang Seng Tech Index and Hang Seng Automobile Index, which fell 1.5% and 1.7% respectively.  
该股一度跌至 47 港元（6.05 美元），为 9 月 11 日以来的最低水平，并成为香港恒生科技指数和恒生汽车指数中百分比跌幅最大的成分股，后两股分别下跌 1.5% 和 1.7%。

The drop followed a Wednesday report on the lawsuit from Chinese financial news magazine Caixin.  
在中国财经新闻杂志《财新》周三报道了这起诉讼之后，股价出现下跌。

In the lawsuit, filed in August in the U.S district court for the southern district of New York, GIC said NIO and two executives misled investors with false statements and withheld information about its business and prospects.  
新加坡政府投资公司于 8 月份向美国纽约南区地方法院提起诉讼，指控蔚来汽车及其两名高管以虚假陈述误导投资者，并隐瞒了有关其业务和前景的信息。

NIO and GIC declined to comment on Thursday.  
蔚来汽车和新加坡政府投资公司周四拒绝置评。
