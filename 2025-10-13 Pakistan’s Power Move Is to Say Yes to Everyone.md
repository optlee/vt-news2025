### Takeaways by Bloomberg AI彭博人工智能的要点

- Pakistan's leaders are managing to work with rival superpowers, including the US and China, by giving each a stake in the country's economy.  
	巴基斯坦领导人正在设法与包括美国和中国在内的竞争对手超级大国合作，让它们各自持有巴基斯坦经济的股份。
- The nation has secured new investments, including $8.5 billion from China, and has signed a mutual defense agreement with Saudi Arabia.  
	该国已获得新的投资，其中包括来自中国的 85 亿美元投资，并与沙特阿拉伯签署了共同防御协议。
- Pakistan is offering the US a port to develop in the southwestern province of Balochistan, which could serve as a route to the country's mineral resources.  
	巴基斯坦向美国提出在西南部俾路支省开发一个港口，该港口可以作为通往该国矿产资源的路线。

Pakistan’s leaders have worked out how to manage two rival superpowers in a way that seems to have escaped much more stable nations. They’re promisingthe US a foothold in the economy that doesn’t step on China’s — and vice versa. Their response to a multipolar world is to give every pole a stake.  
巴基斯坦领导人已经找到了一种似乎在其他更加稳定的国家都难以找到的方法，来管理两个相互竞争的超级大国。他们承诺美国在巴基斯坦经济中拥有一个立足点，而不会损害中国的利益——反之亦然。他们对多极世界的回应是，让每一极都拥有自己的利益。

In the past months, the nation’s vulnerability has been starkly visible. Monsoon [floods](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/pakistan-floods-batter-fields-factories-fiscal-plans-2025-09-23/) damaged half the crops, killed a thousand people, and displaced millions. The government is still trying to [persuade](https://www.dawn.com/news/1947585) the International Monetary Fund to release $1.2 billion it needs to stay solvent.  
过去几个月，该国的脆弱性显而易见。季风 [洪水](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/pakistan-floods-batter-fields-factories-fiscal-plans-2025-09-23/) 摧毁了一半的农作物，造成一千人死亡，数百万人流离失所。政府仍在努力 [说服](https://www.dawn.com/news/1947585) 国际货币基金组织提供其维持偿付能力所需的 12 亿美元。

And yet its leaders are managing to win friends and influence people. Last month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif visited Beijing and [announced](https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-china-investment-agreement-beijing-70ca7b7098c11acf9a9d520328476c68) $8.5 billion of new investment. More recently, a mutual defense [agreement](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/newsletters/2025-09-27/us-isolation-brings-saudi-arabia-and-pakistan-closer-together) with Saudi Arabia that might extend Pakistan’s nuclear umbrella was signed.  
然而，巴基斯坦领导人正在努力赢得朋友并影响民众。上个月，巴基斯坦总理谢赫巴兹·谢里夫访问北京，并 [宣布](https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-china-investment-agreement-beijing-70ca7b7098c11acf9a9d520328476c68) 新增 85 亿美元的投资。最近，巴基斯坦与沙特阿拉伯签署了一项共同防御 [协议](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/newsletters/2025-09-27/us-isolation-brings-saudi-arabia-and-pakistan-closer-together) ，该协议可能扩大巴基斯坦的核保护伞。

Impressively, Islamabad is managing all this even while locking in gains with the US.Its dependence on China and renewed intimacy with the Saudis haven’t put off Washington — quite the opposite, in fact. President Donald Trump has hosted the military chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir, [twice](https://www.whitehouse.gov/gallery/president-donald-trump-meets-with-prime-minister-shehbaz-sharif-and-field-marshal-asim-munir-of-pakistan/) [in](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/india-will-not-accept-third-party-mediation-relations-with-pakistan-modi-tells-2025-06-18/) recent months.  
令人印象深刻的是，伊斯兰堡在锁定与美国利益的同时，却做到了这一切。它对中国的依赖以及与沙特重新建立的亲密关系并没有让华盛顿却步——事实上，恰恰相反。近几个月 [来，](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/india-will-not-accept-third-party-mediation-relations-with-pakistan-modi-tells-2025-06-18/) 唐纳德·特朗普总统已 [两次](https://www.whitehouse.gov/gallery/president-donald-trump-meets-with-prime-minister-shehbaz-sharif-and-field-marshal-asim-munir-of-pakistan/) 接见了军事首领阿西姆·穆尼尔元帅。

How has the Pakistani establishment — run essentially by Munir and his soldiers, without whom Sharif could not stay in office — managed this? Partly though skilfully re-assessing what a multipolar world actually looks like, and by putting together bespoke offers for possible partners that look too good to refuse.  
巴基斯坦当权派——主要由穆尼尔和他的军队掌控，没有他们，谢里夫就无法继续执政——是如何做到这一点的？部分原因是他们巧妙地重新评估了多极世界的实际面貌，并为潜在合作伙伴提出了令人难以拒绝的定制方案。

The US, for example, has reportedly been presented with a port to develop in the southwestern province of Balochistan — possibly as a route to the [mineral resources](https://www.economist.com/asia/2025/10/09/the-global-gold-booms-150bn-final-frontier-pakistan) in the interior that Islamabad has already promised the White House.  
例如，据报道，美国已获准在西南部的俾路支省开发一个港口，这可能是通往内陆 [矿产资源的](https://www.economist.com/asia/2025/10/09/the-global-gold-booms-150bn-final-frontier-pakistan) 路线，伊斯兰堡已经向白宫承诺过这一点。

The offer is a physical manifestation of Pakistan’s developing “please-everybody” strategy. The fishing village in question, Pasni, is 110 kilometers (70 miles) from the Chinese-run port of Gwadar, the southern terminus of Beijing’s ambitious corridor from the Arabian Sea to Xinjiang. If, as official sources have [confirmed](https://dunyanews.tv/en/Pakistan/910186-pasni-port-security-wont-be-shared-with-any-country-security-sources), Pasni is to play “a vital role in transporting Pakistani minerals to partner countries,” then it appears that Munir and Sharif imagine two parallel tracks bisecting their country, one built for China and one serving the West.  
这项提议是巴基斯坦正在酝酿的“取悦所有人”战略的具体体现。这个渔村帕斯尼距离中国运营的瓜达尔港 110 公里（70 英里），而瓜达尔港正是北京雄心勃勃的从阿拉伯海到新疆的“一带一路”走廊的南端。如果真如官方消息所 [证实](https://dunyanews.tv/en/Pakistan/910186-pasni-port-security-wont-be-shared-with-any-country-security-sources) ，帕斯尼将在“巴基斯坦矿产向伙伴国家运输过程中发挥至关重要的作用”，那么穆尼尔和谢里夫似乎在设想两条平行的轨道将他们的国家一分为二，一条服务于中国，另一条服务于西方。

There’s real money in play, as well. Missouri-based US Strategic Metals has [signed](https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-us-company-signed-deal-minerals-78397bef33518d645a3a248275d84a0c?) a $500-million contract with an army-run company, the Frontier Works Organization. The Asian Development Bank has [created](https://www.adb.org/news/adb-approves-financing-transformative-reko-diq-copper-mining-project-pakistan) a $410 million financing package for Barrick Mining Corp.’s [Reko Diq](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-08/barrick-approves-project-plan-for-copper-gold-mine-in-pakistan) mine, which is close to the Iranian border and 400 kilometers (250 miles) north of Pasni. The International Finance Corporation, a multilateral agency, will add [another $400 million](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/ifc-provide-400-million-loan-pakistans-copper-gold-reko-diq-mine-2025-06-13/) to try and develop one of the world’s largest remaining reserves of copper and gold.  
这其中也涉及真金白银。总部位于密苏里州的美国战略金属公司（US Strategic Metals）与一家名为“边境工程组织”（Frontier Works Organization）的军方公司 [签署了](https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-us-company-signed-deal-minerals-78397bef33518d645a3a248275d84a0c?) 一份价值 5 亿美元的合同。亚洲开发银行为巴里克矿业公司（Barrick Mining Corp.）的雷科迪克矿 [（Reko Diq）](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-08/barrick-approves-project-plan-for-copper-gold-mine-in-pakistan) [提供了](https://www.adb.org/news/adb-approves-financing-transformative-reko-diq-copper-mining-project-pakistan) [4.1 亿美元的融资方案，该矿靠近伊朗边境，位于帕斯尼以北 400 公里（250 英里）。多边机构国际金融公司（International Finance Corporation）将再追加 4 亿美元，](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/ifc-provide-400-million-loan-pakistans-copper-gold-reko-diq-mine-2025-06-13/) 试图开发世界上现存最大的铜金储量之一。

Even if there is gold in Balochistan, getting it out of the ground isn’t the only challenge. Transporting it to the coast is harder. This is an inhospitable part of the world, as every outsider since Alexander has discovered. (The conqueror’s most difficult days were near Pasni, [where](https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/baluchistan-i/) the Greeks suffered from “intolerable heat and the lack of food, water and firewood,” and lost most of his army’s families and transport animals to a flash flood.)  
即使俾路支省有黄金，将其从地下开采出来也并非唯一的挑战。将其运输到海岸更加困难。自亚历山大以来，每个外来者都发现，这里是世界上一个荒凉的地方。（这位征服者最艰难的日子是在帕斯尼附近，希腊人 [在那里](https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/baluchistan-i/) 遭受着“难以忍受的酷热和缺乏食物、水和柴火”的折磨，他的军队的大部分家属和运输牲畜在一场山洪中丧生。）

The Baloch have always been restive under Islamabad’s yoke, and have killed [almost 100](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-21/rise-in-violence-against-chinese-nationals-in-pakistan/104487244) Chinese expatriates in recent years. If the US truly intends to put down roots, it will have to deal with local opposition. Officials may already be preparing for this: In August, the State Department [added](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/11/us-puts-balochistan-armed-group-in-pakistan-on-foreign-terrorist-list) the Balochistan Liberation Army to its list of foreign terrorist organizations, something of a [reversal](https://tribune.com.pk/story/334449/us-congressional-hearing-on-balochistan-ill-advised-move-sherry-rehman) from how Washington viewed the area a decade ago.

Islamabad might have failed for decades to create the sort of productive, dynamic economy that builds anything the world might want to buy. But that doesn’t mean there’s nothing left to sell. You can still slice off your sovereignty: Outsource fiscal policy to the IMF, share your nuclear umbrella with the Saudis, mortgage your energy infrastructure to the Chinese, and promise the Americans minerals that are still in the ground.

This strategy may have bought the Pakistani establishment another few years. Munir and Sharif must not waste it. They will need to ensure the promised money gets spent, and the hoped-for rewards materialize. And they must use both the treasure and time they have deftly unearthed to stabilize the country’s creaking economy.
