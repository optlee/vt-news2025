The inside story on the Asia tech trends that matter, from Nikkei Asia and the Financial Times  
《日经亚洲》和《金融时报》关于亚洲科技趋势的重要内幕报道

Hello from Tokyo, this is Katherine Creel, your host for this week's #techAsia.  
来自东京的问候，我是凯瑟琳·克里尔 (Katherine Creel)，本周#techAsia 的主持人。

Here in Japan, the big question in political circles is "Who will be Japan's next prime minister?" The answer seemed pretty cut-and-dried after Sanae Takaichi won the Liberal Democratic Party leadership vote, but an unexpected bout of [political upheaval](https://asia.nikkei.com/politics/japan-leadership-race/japan-s-komeito-leaves-ruling-coalition-dealing-blow-to-takaichi-s-ldp) has thrown that certainty out the window  
在日本，政界最大的疑问是“谁将成为日本下一任首相？”在高市早苗赢得自民党党魁选举后，答案似乎已成定局，但一场意外的 [政治动荡](https://asia.nikkei.com/politics/japan-leadership-race/japan-s-komeito-leaves-ruling-coalition-dealing-blow-to-takaichi-s-ldp) 打破了这种确定性。

In the world of global tech and investment, meanwhile, the question is: "When will the AI bubble burst?"  
与此同时，在全球科技和投资领域，一个问题是：“人工智能泡沫何时会破裂？”

Former Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger is the latest tech figure to argue that the rush of spending on chips and data centers means we are indeed in a bubble ("Of course we are," he recently told CNBC). No one, however, is in a rush to predict its imminent end. Chip tool maker Applied Materials, like Gelsinger, says the boom has [years of life left in it](https://asia.nikkei.com/business/tech/semiconductors/applied-materials-says-chipmaking-is-entering-the-atomic-era).  
英特尔前首席执行官帕特·基辛格是最新一位提出芯片和数据中心支出激增意味着我们确实处于泡沫中的科技界人士（他最近告诉 CNBC：“当然是了。”）。然而，没有人急于预测泡沫即将终结。芯片工具制造商应用材料公司和基辛格一样，表示这轮繁荣 [还能持续数年](https://asia.nikkei.com/business/tech/semiconductors/applied-materials-says-chipmaking-is-entering-the-atomic-era) 。

Questions over the rationale of this funding frenzy are growing alongside evidence that, in the real world, AI is falling short of promises. Back in June, Gartner projected that 40% of agentic AI projects will be canceled by the end of 2027. (AI agents purport to take over more complex human-like decision making processes.) A more recent report by SEO agency Graphite found that around half of articles online are now generated by AI -- but with the caveat that they are probably not being viewed in proportion by actual humans.  
越来越多的证据表明，在现实世界中，人工智能未能兑现承诺，人们对这波资金热潮的合理性提出了质疑。今年 6 月，Gartner 预测，到 2027 年底，40%的代理人工智能项目将被取消。（人工智能代理声称能够接管更复杂的类人决策过程。）搜索引擎优化机构 Graphite 最近发布的一份报告发现，目前大约一半的在线文章是由人工智能生成的——但需要注意的是，这些文章的阅读量可能远不及真人阅读量。

So, AI agents are not very good at being agents and AI writers aren't great at reaching readers, at least yet. Reassuring news for journalists and creative types worried about their jobs. Less so for anyone wondering when the trillions of dollars in AI infrastructure investments will start to pay off.  
所以，至少目前而言，AI 代理还不够擅长代理，AI 作家也不太擅长接触读者。这对那些担心自己工作难保的记者和创意人士来说，是个好消息。但对于那些想知道数万亿美元的 AI 基础设施投资何时才能开始获得回报的人来说，这可就难说了。

And yet those investments rumble on. Just this week, Google announced it will spend $15 billion over five years building AI data center capacity in India, while Singaporean data center operator BDx is planning a ["significant" investment](https://asia.nikkei.com/business/technology/singapore-s-bdx-doubles-down-on-indonesia-in-data-center-push) focused on Indonesia as part of its growth plans for the region.  
然而，这些投资仍在继续。就在本周，谷歌宣布将在五年内斥资 150 亿美元在印度建设人工智能数据中心，而新加坡数据中心运营商 BDx 正计划在印度尼西亚进行一项 [“重大”投资，](https://asia.nikkei.com/business/technology/singapore-s-bdx-doubles-down-on-indonesia-in-data-center-push) 作为其在该地区增长计划的一部分。

In South Korea, association with AI chip king Nvidia and ChatGPT developer OpenAI has boosted the fortunes -- and share prices -- of Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, two of the most important suppliers of advanced memory for artificial intelligence chips. Samsung is on track to post its [best quarter in three years](https://asia.nikkei.com/business/tech/semiconductors/samsung-profit-surges-30-in-q3-on-strong-memory-chip-demand).  
在韩国，与人工智能芯片巨头英伟达（Nvidia）以及 ChatGPT 开发商 OpenAI 的合作，提振了三星电子和 SK 海力士的业绩，以及股价。这两家公司是人工智能芯片先进内存最重要的供应商。三星有望创下 [三年来最佳季度业绩](https://asia.nikkei.com/business/tech/semiconductors/samsung-profit-surges-30-in-q3-on-strong-memory-chip-demand) 。

Back in 2007, Chuck Prince, then CEO of Citigroup, described his banking strategy thus: "As long as the music is playing, you've got to get up and dance." It is not hard to see a similar ethos at work in the current investment supercycle. But if AI applications don't start living up to their hype, there will be a lot of sore feet when this tune ends.  
早在 2007 年，时任花旗集团首席执行官的查克·普林斯（Chuck Prince）就曾这样描述他的银行战略：“只要音乐还在响，你就得起身舞动。” 在当前的投资超级周期中，不难看出类似的理念在发挥作用。但如果人工智能应用不能真正兑现其宣传，那么当这轮投资周期结束时，许多人都会感到沮丧。

## The divide deepens 分歧加深

Microsoft and AWS are stepping up efforts to shift production away from China, particularly for sensitive products like data center servers, **Lauly Li** and **Cheng** **Ting-Fang** report in this Nikkei Asia exclusive.  
据日经亚洲 **独家** 报道 **，** **微软** 和 AWS 正在加大力度将生产转移出中国，特别是数据中心服务器等敏感产品。

Executives at suppliers to the U.S. tech companies say Microsoft aims to have its new Surface laptops and data servers made completely outside of China [as early as next year](https://asia.nikkei.com/spotlight/supply-chain/microsoft-aims-to-make-most-new-products-outside-china-from-2026-sources), even down to components. AWS similarly wants to have as much of its data center supply chain as possible located outside of the country given the political sensitivity of those devices, sources said.  
美国科技公司供应商的高管表示，微软计划 [最早明年](https://asia.nikkei.com/spotlight/supply-chain/microsoft-aims-to-make-most-new-products-outside-china-from-2026-sources) 就将其新款 Surface 笔记本电脑和数据服务器完全在中国境外生产，甚至包括零部件。消息人士称，鉴于这些设备的政治敏感性，AWS 同样希望将其数据中心供应链尽可能多地设在中国境外。

While some components remain hard to source from alternative locations for logistical or economic reasons, these companies' stepped-up efforts underscore their desire to mitigate geopolitical risks stemming from ongoing U.S.-China tensions.  
尽管由于物流或经济原因，一些零部件仍然难以从其他地方采购，但这些公司加大努力凸显了他们希望减轻持续的中美紧张局势带来的地缘政治风险。

## Chips under scrutiny 芯片受到严格审查

China has escalated enforcement of its semiconductor import controls, mobilizing customs officers at major ports to conduct stringent checks on advanced chip shipments, the Financial Times' **Zijing Wu** and **Cheng Leng** write.  
《金融时报》的 **吴子静** 和 **冷程** 写道，中国已加大对半导体进口管制的执法力度，调动主要港口的海关官员对先进芯片的运输进行严格检查。

The inspections began with the aim of ensuring local companies [stop ordering Nvidia's China-specific chips](https://on.ft.com/4hadKEr) following guidance from Chinese regulators to discourage their purchase, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.  
据三位知情人士透露，此次检查的目的是确保当地企业按照中国监管机构的指导 [停止订购英伟达的中国专用芯片，](https://on.ft.com/4hadKEr) 以阻止他们购买。

But one person said the checks had been extended more recently to all advanced semiconductor products in an attempt to target the smuggling of high-end chips that breach U.S. export curbs. Chinese customs had previously done little to prevent chip imports as long as the appropriate duties were paid at the border.  
但一位知情人士表示，检查范围最近已扩大到所有先进半导体产品，旨在打击违反美国出口限制的高端芯片走私活动。此前，只要在边境缴纳相应关税，中国海关几乎不会采取任何措施阻止芯片进口。

The crackdown, coordinated with the Cyberspace Administration of China, underscores Beijing's determination to ensure its tech sector breaks free from American technology and help the country win the AI race.  
此次打击行动与中国国家互联网信息办公室协调进行，凸显了北京方面确保其科技行业摆脱美国技术、帮助中国赢得人工智能竞赛的决心。

## The funding frontier 融资前沿

Space and defense investment has been a key driver of venture capital deals this year. But from Japan and China to Europe, the activity is being driven [largely by governments](https://asia.nikkei.com/business/technology/tech-asia/in-japan-and-beyond-space-startups-are-relying-more-on-government-cash), not private money, writes Nikkei Asia's **Mitsuru Obe**.  
太空和国防投资是今年风险投资交易的主要驱动力。但日经亚洲的 **Mitsuru Obe** 写道，从日本、中国到欧洲，这些活动 [主要由政府](https://asia.nikkei.com/business/technology/tech-asia/in-japan-and-beyond-space-startups-are-relying-more-on-government-cash) 推动，而非私人资金。

Governments see startups as an important avenue for boosting national security amid growing geopolitical tensions and uncertainty. Their support for the sector takes various forms, from direct funding to contracts for projects.  
在地缘政治紧张局势和不确定性日益加剧的背景下，各国政府将初创企业视为提升国家安全的重要途径。政府对该行业的支持形式多样，从直接资助到项目合同。

Private investors, meanwhile, are showing signs of impatience with the lack of profitability and exit opportunities that the sector offers.  
与此同时，私人投资者对该行业缺乏盈利能力和退出机会表现出不耐烦的迹象。

It is not all doom and gloom, however. In Japan alone, for example, five space startups have gone public since 2023.  
然而，并非一切都黯淡无光。例如，仅在日本，自2023年以来就有五家太空初创公司上市。

## Squeezed higher 挤压得更高

Beijing's move to further restrict exports of rare earths roiled supply chains and foreign governments, but it has been [a boon for Chinese miners](https://asia.nikkei.com/economy/trade-war/china-s-rare-earth-miners-flying-high-as-export-rules-tighten2), Nikkei Asia's **Kenji Kawase** writes.  
日经亚洲的 **Kenji Kawase** 写道，北京进一步限制稀土出口的举措扰乱了供应链和外国政府，但 [对中国矿商来说却是一个福音](https://asia.nikkei.com/economy/trade-war/china-s-rare-earth-miners-flying-high-as-export-rules-tighten2) 。

Shares in China Rare Earth Resources and Technology touched an all-time high on Tuesday, while Xiamen Tungsten surpassed the recent high it marked in September 2021. Shenghe Resources Holding, backed by China's Finance Ministry, issued glowing profit guidance the same day.  
中国稀土资源科技的股价周二创下历史新高，而厦门钨业则突破了2021年9月创下的近期高点。在中国财政部的支持下，盛和资源控股在同一天发布了令人鼓舞的盈利预期。

China is the world's leading producer of rare earths, essential ingredients in a wide range of tech and defense applications. Prices have been elevated since April, when the Chinese government imposed export restrictions on seven of 17 key minerals amid a trade war with the U.S. On Thursday, the Ministry of Commerce announced it was adding five more rare-earth minerals to the export control list.  
中国是世界领先的稀土生产国，稀土是广泛科技和国防应用的关键成分。自今年4月中国政府在中美贸易战中对17种主要矿产中的7种实施出口限制以来，稀土价格持续上涨。周四，中国商务部宣布将另外5种稀土矿产列入出口管制清单。

One of the big questions now is whether this latest measure is "just" a negotiating tactic or the new normal.
